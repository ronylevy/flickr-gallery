flickrGallery

As a bonus, I added the functionallity for the user to save liked images in a different page ("liked images").

For that, I added a "like" favicon icon. On click, the image is stored in a differente array (in the state of the gallery component). 

I used conditional rendering to switch between pages, and display either the array with all the images or the one with the liked ones. 

I also made both arrays unique, cleaning the array of images after the fetch request.

I hope you guys enjoy!

Thank you so much for the opportunity to participate on the process! I am trully gratefull!
